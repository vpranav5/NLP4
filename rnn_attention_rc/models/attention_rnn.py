        passage: Variable(LongTensor)
            A Variable(LongTensor) of shape (batch_size, passage_length)
            representing the words in the passage for each batch.

        -------
        An output dictionary consisting of:

            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Each value is the score

            small scores (-1e7).

        end_logits: Variable(FloatTensor)
            The second element in the returned tuple. Variable(FloatTensor) of

            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Exactly the same as

            a probability distribution over the passage, indicating the

            The fourth element in the returned tuple. Variable(FloatTensor) of
            shape (batch_size, max_passage_size). Exactly the same as
